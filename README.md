# Expense-Tracker
Managing finances has never been easier with this comprehensive tool. It lets you track monthly, daily, and yearly incomes and expenses through interactive graphs. Plus, watch your monthly expenses reset to zero as a new month begins!

But that's not all! Our project is packed with features like group creation, category management, and even subcategories. Whether it's 'Education' with subcategories like 'Coaching Fees' or 'School Fees,' you have it all covered.

Worried about keeping track of your bank accounts? No problem! Our bank account integration ensures accuracy and convenience. 

Adding expenses and incomes is a breeze with condition-based image management. Cash transactions automatically set a fitting default image, while online transactions allow you to upload receipts. Forget to upload? We've got you covered with 'Image Not Uploaded' placeholders.

Navigate through your records seamlessly with a user-friendly interface. Sort, search, edit, and delete records effortlessly. Plus, the report module organizes all your transactions in a table format. Copy or download records in CSV, Excel, and PDF formats with a single click.

Security is paramount. Only logged-in users access the various modules, and logout functionality ensures data privacy. Forgot your password? No worries, our integrated mailer system has you covered.
